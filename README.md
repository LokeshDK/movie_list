# Movie_list
Udacity movies project

This project contains my list of favourite movies. The code was written in Python and contains 3 .py files.

#### Media.py
This py contains only 1 method **Movie** with parameters as _title, storyline, poster_image_url, trailer_youtube_url_. 

### Entertainment_center.py
This py file contains the code which inherits media.py and **multiple objects of media class** is been created calling Movie class (which contains details of my favourite movies).

### fresh_tomatoes.py
This py file contains HTML code which generates HTML file with pre-defined method using bootstrap functions and css.

# Installation
